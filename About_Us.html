        <h3>Introduction; More About Us</h3>
        <p>Ruralnet ICT Academy (RICT) is an Accredited exam center for both KASNEB/ TVETA and CSK aimed at providing ICT education to the rural population located in Siaya County in a town called Ugunja along Busia-Kisumu highway. The Academy aims to bridge the digital divide between rural and urban areas by offering high-quality training to the rural population. The Academy offers a range of courses, including computer basics, web design, programming and digital marketing. 

Computer training services, as shown in our plan, have an excellent profitability level and growth rate. Our competitive edge along with new training techniques puts (RICT) at the forefront of training services. We are living in an age where computer knowledge is a must and the market for computer training services is booming.

Our training center will differ from the traditional computer training services usually offered by colleges and universities because of our added personal touch and premium resources.

        <h3>Mission objectives</h3>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>RuralNet ICT Academy’s (RICT) vision is bridging the digital gab between the rural and urban areas.</p>

      <div class="tab-content" id="tab4">
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>The Ruralnet ICT Academy (RICT) knows firsthand that computer training has to meet all of its customers' needs in order to have a tangible lasting impact. When you measure across multiple customer segments—each of which has its own priorities—you see how much more training must do to consistently and simultaneously satisfy participants, managers, and executives. Training then can move to close those gaps and deliver more real value. Closing those gaps between employer skill needs, employee and learner skills development is the main objective of RICT.</p>

        <h3>Brief History ABout us</h3>
        <p>In 2010, Micha Schraven and Lawrence Odongo worked together on a large ICT project in the Sega region. They were both driven by a shared interest in ICT and rural development. In December 2016, they founded the RuralNet Internet Services Provider and IT Academy with the use of the MacBook pro’s that were donated by Service Now. Over time, RuralNet has evolved and is designed to be a social enterprise that is both an Internet Services Provider (ISP) and an associated ICT Academy to interest groups in Kenya’s country side and beyond. RICT Academy advances the communities it operates in through the facilitation of sustainable, quality ICT services and network facility. This is an area that is typically deprived of basic IT resources (Typically IT Students have no computers, internet and electricity). The Academy also has a goal of provision of suitable and stable solar energy as an option for the surrounding business premises, in case there is power outages. This system also preserves the environment since it offers clean and safe energy.</p>
